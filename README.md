NOTE: What is a modal? Here is a link ( https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/w3css_modal.asp ) which you can refer to for a better understanding of what a modal is.

References and API: To get some idea about the UI part – you can refer to this website ( https://www.themealdb.com/ ).

API to fetch a random meal ( https://www.themealdb.com/api/json/v1/1/random.php )

API to fetch a meal based upon a category ( https://www.themealdb.com/api/json/v1/1/filter.php?c=Seafood ) (for eg purpose – the aforementioned API is considering “seafood” as the category)

All the above API’s are taken from this website ( https://www.themealdb.com/api.php ) .

Mandatory Features of the website:

The website should be designed and built for both laptop/desktop and mobile view.
The data must be consumed from the given api’s only.
As mentioned in the above document, its first page (home page) must have a random food item, and a list of all the food items falling in the searched category. Apart from that page, you can create as many pages as you want and you can link that to your food website.
There should be no warnings or error messages in your browser console.
The structure of the website must be the same as described in the above mentioned document.
Dos:

You can google if you need support to recall the syntax.
While designing the prototypes, a. Please design as many screen and as comprehensively as possible. The more the comprehensive the flow you cover, the better it would be. b. Please have a clear design credit on the front screen of both views (mobile and desktop). Design credit = done by who.
You can work on the project even outside the class hours.
You can get inspiration from any food websites ( one of them is even mentioned in the document above ) , if you are doing so the same should be called out by attributing the same (give credits to the project/person from where it is inspired) in the project’s ReadMe file as well as in the code files (as comments).
Don’ts:

You are not allowed to copy and paste the codes from the internet. (Plagiarism is strictly prohibited)
You are not allowed to collaborate with your classmates.
Milestones for the project: These are suggested milestones to help you plan this task. There are just two submission checkpoints, as detailed below.

Milestone 1: Finalise the design for your website.

Milestone 2: Low-fidelity prototype and walkthrough video of the design Figma link of the prototypes (desktop and mobile views) and a walkthrough video to be shared

Milestone 3: Fetching the data from the given api’s and displaying the data on the website ( for this milestone you are just required to fetch and display data on your website - without any css for now. )

Milestone 5: Testing and Bug fixing - Make sure there are no warning messages or error messages on your browser console. Once done, please submit your final website as detailed below in the submission guidelines.

Deliverables for Design for Developers:

Link to the low-fid Figma prototypes (both desktop and mobile views)
Walk-through video covering both views
Deliverables for Front-end Web Development:

After building the project, the project files and project deployed link must be shared.

Your code repo link
The project output link
